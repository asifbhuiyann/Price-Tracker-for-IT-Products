            <li> <strong>User Accounts and Syncing:</strong> Price trackers often allow users to create accounts, enabling them to sync their
                tracked products and settings across different devices.</li> 
            <li> <strong>Real-Time Price Monitoring:</strong>  Price trackers continuously monitor the prices of products from various online
                retailers, e-commerce websites, and marketplaces. This ensures that users have access to the most up-to-date
                pricing information.</li>
        
            <li> <strong>Price History Tracking:</strong> Many price trackers offer historical price data, allowing users to view price trends
                over time. This helps users identify patterns, track seasonal fluctuations, and determine the best times to
                make purchases.</li>
            <li> <strong>Price Drop Alerts:</strong> Users can set up alerts for specific products. When the price of a tracked product falls
                to a specified threshold, the price tracker sends notifications via email, SMS, or mobile app. This feature
                allows users to take advantage of price drops and discounts.</li>
            <li> <strong>Product Availability Tracking:</strong>  Some price trackers also monitor the availability of products, notifying
                users when items are back in stock or become available for purchase.</li>
            <li> <strong>Product Reviews and Ratings:</strong>  Some price trackers provide aggregated product reviews and ratings from various
                sources, helping users make informed decisions beyond just price considerations.</li>
        </ul>
